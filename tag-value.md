# <i class="pi pi-tag-value4value"></i>podcast:value
**A payment layer for podcasts for direct payments from listeners: inexpensive, instant and global.**

* [The official specification](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#value)

- - -

This tag is for podcasters to create a direct stream of income from the audience independently from sponsoring.

**For podcasters the tag enables:**
* a new source of income through direct one-time payments (boosts) and payment streams by the minute from listeners
* new ways of interaction between podcasters and listeners though one-time payments with messages (boostagrams)  

**For hosting services and podcast apps the tag enables:**
* a new source of revenue through [split payments](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md#value-recipient-element)
* a way to help more podcasters become independently funded

## Support

This is easy to implement for both podcast hosting companies and podcast apps.

It's supported by [a number of podcast apps](https://podcastindex.org/apps?appTypes=podcast+player&elements=Value) including _Podverse_, _Breez_, _Fountain_ and _CurioCaster_. It has passed the Apple app store review.

It's supported by [large podcast hosts](https://podcastindex.org/apps?appTypes=hosting&elements=Value) including  _RSS.com_, _Castos_, _JustCast_ and _RSS Blue_.

This monetization model is based on Value for Value. Listeners give value back to the podcaster. Learn more about it [here](https://value4value.info/)

## An example in the wild

RSS.com integrated the [Alby Podcaster Wallet API](https://blog.getalby.com/introducing-the-alby-wallet-api/)

Listen on a <value:tag> enabled podcast player such as Fountain.fm, select the podcast and send a payment with a message (boostagram).
